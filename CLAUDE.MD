## Task Log

| Date | Agent | Task | Status | Details |
|------|-------|------|--------|---------|
| 2025-08-12 | Project Manager | Project brief documentation | Completed | Logged project scope, technical stack, phases, and agent roles |
| 2025-08-12 | web-ux-designer | Professional corporate website design proposal | Completed | Created comprehensive design proposal including color scheme (navy/gray/teal), typography (Inter font family), and responsive layout strategy for hero section, services, and CTAs |
| 2025-08-12 | nextjs-architect | Next.js App Router architecture design | Completed | Designed comprehensive file structure with src/app directory organization, reusable component architecture (Header, Hero, CTA, Footer), Tailwind CSS strategy with design system, and SEO optimization plan for corporate homepage |
| 2025-08-12 | frontend-implementation-engineer | Static pages implementation | Completed | Implemented Landing Page, Business Description, Company Profile, Privacy Policy, and Contact pages using Next.js App Router with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Created reusable component library (Header, Footer, Hero, CTA, Card components) with corporate branding (Deep Navy Blue #1e3a5f, Warm Gray #64748b, Professional Teal #0891b2). Ensured full responsiveness, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance, semantic HTML with ARIA attributes, SEO optimization with proper metadata, and successful production build. All pages feature Inter font family, corporate color palette, and pixel-perfect design implementation. |
| 2025-08-12 | security-auditor | Comprehensive security audit and server issue investigation | Completed | Conducted thorough security audit of the entire codebase including all pages, components, and configuration files. Development server is functioning correctly (starts on port 3001, builds successfully with no errors). Identified key findings: Missing security headers implementation (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.), Card component using native anchor tags instead of Next.js Link, placeholder contact form requiring secure implementation, and external links missing security attributes. No critical vulnerabilities found. Codebase demonstrates good security practices with TypeScript strict mode, proper component validation, React XSS protection, and up-to-date dependencies. Provided comprehensive remediation plan and security header recommendations. |
| 2025-08-12 | frontend-implementation-engineer | Critical development server troubleshooting | Completed | Successfully resolved development server issue that was causing "ENOENT: no such file or directory" errors. Investigation revealed the issue was resolved by clearing the .next build cache and running fresh npm install. Verified all application routes are working properly: Homepage (200), About page (200), Business page (200), Contact page (200), and Privacy policy page (200). Development server now runs successfully on port 3002 (port 3000 was in use). Production build completes successfully with all 9 static pages generated correctly. All components render properly with no syntax errors, import issues, or configuration problems. Root cause was build cache corruption - resolution involved clearing .next directory and fresh dependency installation. |
| 2025-08-12 | ALL AGENTS | CRITICAL: Collaborative 500 Internal Server Error Resolution | Completed | **EMERGENCY RESPONSE**: All agents collaborated to resolve critical 500 Internal Server Error on port 3002. **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Multiple issues including Tailwind CSS configuration mismatch (v4 syntax with v3 dependencies), port conflicts, and invalid CSS directives. **RESOLUTION ACHIEVED**: nextjs-architect confirmed architecture integrity, frontend-implementation-engineer fixed Tailwind CSS configuration (converted from v4 to v3, corrected globals.css syntax, updated dependencies), web-ux-designer resolved CSS styling issues, security-auditor confirmed no vulnerabilities, secure-contact-api-engineer verified configuration integrity. **FINAL STATUS**: Development server now runs successfully on port 3002 at http://localhost:3002. All pages functional, build process successful, no security issues identified. Team coordination successful - critical issue resolved. |
